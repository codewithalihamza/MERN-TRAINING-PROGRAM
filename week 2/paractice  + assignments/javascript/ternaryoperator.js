// What is a Ternary operator?
// A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition.

// Its syntax is:

// condition ? expression1 : expression2
// The ternary operator evaluates the test condition.

// If the condition is true, expression1 is executed.
// If the condition is false, expression2 is executed.


var a=13;
var result = (a%2==0)? "Even number": "Odd number";
console.log(result);




// ternary operator to check the eligibility to vote
// let age = 15;
// let result = (age >= 18) ? "You are eligible to vote." : "You are not eligible to vote yet";
// console.log(result);





// one more method which i develop (just like if else if condition)

// var marks=420;
// var result=(marks>=500)? "you are 500+ marks" :(marks>=400) ? "you are 400+ marks": "you are fail";
// console.log(result);
